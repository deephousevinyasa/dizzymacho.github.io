We broke the curse! Cornbread was tasty as ever last week. I didn't brush my teeth for a few days just so I could savor the goodness. Skaggs was up bright and early whistling Skynyrd and cooking cornbread. I like where today is heading.

### Cornbread POTW - Week 8
After last weeks explosion against Illinois, and the possibility of Adrian Martinez not being able to play this week. I don't see how the Huskers can pull this off. Make sure your shoes are tied, we could be running away with this one.

**Minnesota -7 (vs. Nebraska)**

### Poncho's Power Play
I don't typically throw around hard earned money on the likes of the NFL, but Poncho sent me one that was too good to pass up.

**Carolina -2 (vs. Bucs)**

See you at the window...
