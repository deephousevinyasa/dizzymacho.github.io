Pleasure doing business with you last week... but no time for funny business...that sweet corn cake is ready to be served.

### Cornbread POTW - Week 5
Skaggs met a guy at Jimmy Au's from Toledo who really likes Ed and the Tigers in Nash-Vegas this weekend. Said he was a real nice guy until he rode off on his bicycle.

Throw a couple units the other way and hold on tight.
