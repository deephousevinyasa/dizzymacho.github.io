Well boys... the Lieutenant won it outright with a backdoor cover last week. It's not how we wanted it to play out, but as they always say "you can't win if you don't play." Let's see what's on the sheet this week.

### Cornbread POTW - Week 4

Skaggs talked to some arrogant bastard at the store last week. This guy kept going on and on about how the Rebels win against Arkansas makes them a "top contender" in the SEC West. I'm no Paul Finebaum... but I'm better looking, smarter, more endowed, and make one helluva cornbread.

_Why do Ole Miss fans keep their diplomas on their dashboards?_

_So they can park in the handicap spaces..._

We're going to see those lions roar today boys!!! Don't be shy with the units on this one.

**SE Louisiana +31 (vs. Ole Miss)**

See you at the window...
