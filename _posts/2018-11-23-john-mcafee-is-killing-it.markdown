I was trolling through Twitter the other day and came across a fantastic post by Mr. John McAfee. If you don't know who he is, this island hopping, crypto pumping security expert is addicted to being the man.  

Don't just take my word for it, watch [his documentary on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80148180).  

John casually tweets about a woman at a bar in Hatteras that wants to bang him and rebuttals someone who says he looks like a corroded testicle.

[I had the screenshots of the Tweets here before. It was funny enough for me to write a post. Need to get them from my phone if anyone really cares to see]

You just keep being awesome "John F@#&king McAfee".
