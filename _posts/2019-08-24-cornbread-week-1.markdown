Football its back, but I don’t have to tell you degenerates. I know you’re hungry...

You’ve satisfied your appetite the last few months watching men play their  "white-collar" hobby, but it’s not a full meal. The skillet is hot and cornbread is cooking...

Skaggs is ready to lay down some cash and the Blue Horseshoe doesn’t blink when Skaggs is ready to play. 

Here’s what we got this week...

### Cornbread Week 1

The only difference between Florida and an oven is that an oven doesn’t produce serial killers. There should be enough of them on the field tonight as the “Sunshine State” hosts UF vs. Miami. I’m sure it will smell just like the state of Florida looks (a floppy dick) but that shouldn’t stop these boys from hoot'in ands holler'in  in the end zone. 

I don’t care if it’s raining, I’m taking a bite of the over. 

`Florida/Miami Over 45.5`

See you at the window...
