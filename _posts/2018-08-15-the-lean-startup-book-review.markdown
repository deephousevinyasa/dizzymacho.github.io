description: Great read for anyone in Product Management.
---

This is a great read for anyone interested in getting into product management or for anyone trying to flesh out that new business idea. It was recommended to me by a Product Manager from Pivotal Labs, Alex Sherman, after watching him give an Intro to Product Management class at General Assembly.

Ries defines a start-up as:  

> a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.

The Lean Startup methodology argues for quickly testing and iterating ideas based on customer feedback. Whether these experiments fails or succeed, the cumulative results can help you make smarter decisions for the future of the product.

If you have a start-up/business idea, whether the idea is software related or not, this book is a great "How To Guide" for getting those ideas off the ground and staying lean.
