How 'bout that ðŸ”’ last week boys! I hope you enjoyed that savory treat. For those of you who didn't eat, I'd suggest you skip a meal and have a bite of cornbread.

### Cornbread POTW - Week 3

Yesterday, The Lieutenant walked in with Skaggs feeling 10ft tall after his first week of picks. Now LT definitely has a few Less hairs on his head, limps when he walks, and has glasses thicker than molasses; but by `god` he got a mind sharper than a serpent's tooth. He likes Jimbo and the Aggies this week, but there is a reason why it's called Death Valley.

Dabo and boys have been going to church all week for this one.

`Clemson -17`

See you at the window...
